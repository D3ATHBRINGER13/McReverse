# McReverse Tools

This just holds useful tools for use with reversing Minecraft Bedrock. Presently the only
tool is a method of retrieving the block palette with open source tools.

Its not user friendly and each edition of minecraft is stored in its own branch. Each
supported version will be tagged

The `master` branch will hold a summary of generated artifacts under the `editions` folder

# Artifacts

* `blockpalette.nbt` a dumped block palette with runtime id's. This is in NBT format which can be viewed with any tool
  that supports it
