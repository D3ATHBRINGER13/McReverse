NOTE this is not a complete guide but will contain helpful notes as easier ways are worked out how to figure out stuff. However
ultimately you will be required to decompile and just look at the code to figure stuff out because every compiler is
different enough to make one solution not work.



Looking for the offsets:

* Decompile libminecraftpe.so or Mincraft.Windows.exe using ghidra

* Search memory for string "BlockRuntimeId" which is found inside BlockPalette::getBlock(*this, runtimeId). Nice thing about this function is
it is called often ingame especially if you just leave yourself mounted on a pig.

* Grab the address of the function amd sub the Image base (under Windows->Memory Map)

BlockPalette
  * Offset block start and end can be found inside getBlock. First if checks if the palette is empty, then checks if runtimeId parameter
  is within the range of block_start to block_end
